# Stocka iOS App
The Stocka app, is a simple app to search companies on the stock exchange or via their stock tickers. A successful search brings up information about the company and also provides a link which takes you to the investor page of this company.

# Built With
This app was built with Swift, UIKit and Combine. The app is built in MVVM architecture.

# Getting Started

1. In this app I am using the api from finance modeling prep. Before you can search for companies stocks in the app, you will first need to get an api key from finance modeling prep website - https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/
3. Next enter your api key in the `AppConfig.swift`
```
public static var apiKey = "INSERT_API_KEY_HERE"
```
